## Finding a job is not easy, let me share to you my story.

----

I've sent approximately 50 job applications in Jobstreet, a couple of resume's forwarded by recruiters in LinkedIn and a couple of job posts to various facebook groups. I'm a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, it is a 4 year course, that involves programming lectures and software development. It isn't also an easy course, especially if you don't love mathematics. I struggle in algebra, trigonometry, physics, geometry, discrete mathematics and other mind boggling mathematical subjects. I picked BSIT, off all the dumbest reason, I thought that there is no mathematics in this course.

I'm not that smart. I can't keep up on our first programming subject. It was in Java.

If it weren't because of my classmates, maybe i'm still in college today. I hate it.

I hate it because I don't understand it. It was too difficult to understand. All this syntax, all of the compiler, all of this semicolons, and all of this logic. It was a disaster. I just tend to copy the source code of the smartest guy in our class, and change its variable names and kinda tweak the design. I completely doesn't understand what I'm doing.
