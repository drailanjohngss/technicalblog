CSS in javascript is a new concept for me. Being a web developer for almost 2 years now, I only knew about CSS and some preprocessors.

But now here's a new technology, silently creeping in like a ghost. Kidding aside, I've been reading stuff about styled-components on freecodecamp and dev.to, and honestly I don't know the true potential of it yet, until I began working for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OfficialFarmGoat/">Farmgoat</a>. Honestly speaking I haven't yet mastered the basics of it, but I'm having a clear and concise idea on what it does.

Basically, based on my current understanding <a href="https://www.styled-components.com/"> Syled-components</a> is a tool that let's us write components that possesses their own encapsulated styles.

So what does this mean? well for me, the first step to understand what this is, is to let go what you know about writing traditional css. If you have used React before, then basically, it lets you directly create a component which contains style, which you can use across your project. This way, mapping between styles and components are eliminated.
